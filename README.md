Group repo for final project for COGS108.

The goal of this project was to find the effect of college GPA on factors of career success, namely, salary and job satisfaction. We used data from the National Survey of Recent College Graduates to explore relationships between GPA and other variables across different fields of work. Using visualization and linear regression techniques, we found statistically significant correlations between college GPA and both salary and job satisfaction, and observed differences in these relationships between different college majors.

The complete project can be found in "Final_Project.ipynb" in the same repository.
